# SporTrack

## About

As part of our final year in high school in South Africa, we are required to plan and develop an application to solve a real-world problem.  This is called a PAT (Practical Assessment Task).  For my task I decided to create an application which can be used by any fitness centre so that their members can keep track of their activities and follows others.

## Features

### Post activities

Users can log in and post their own running, swimming or cycling activities.  They can record how long the activity was, the distance of the activity, a name for the activitiy etc.  They can also provide tags which allows the activity to be easily searched.

### Import activities

Users can theoretically import activities from sports tracking devices.  To demonstrate this feature, some fake, non-standard files have been created to show how the files can be imported into the application.  These files can be found in the TestData folder.

NOTE that the app does not support any real devices.

### View, like and comment on others' activities

Users can choose to view other users' activities.  They can then view the activity details, like the activity and comment on it if they wish.  This introduces a social aspect to the application which is essential to building a community inside any fitness centre.

### Search for users and activities

Users can search for other users and activities.  They can then view more details on these users or activities.

### Follow other users

Users can view other users' profiles and choose to follow them.  This will cause all their activities to appear on the current user's main screen.

### Edit user profile

Users can go and edit their profile by adding a profile picture, cover photo, display name, motto etc.

## Software

The following software was used to create the application.

### Delphi 7

Delphi was used for all the coding in the application as well as the creation of the user interfaces.

### Microsoft Office Access

Microsoft Office Access was used to create the database that the application makes use of.
